Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
This project implements the Black-Scholes model to calculate the theoretical price of European call and put options. The Black-Scholes model is a widely used mathematical framework for pricing options in financial markets.

#The Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the price of European-style options using the following inputs:
-Underlying Price (S): The current price of the underlying asset.
-Strike Price (K): The price at which the option can be exercised.
-Time to Expiration (T): The time remaining until the option expires (in years).
-Risk-Free Rate (r): The annualized risk-free interest rate.
-Volatility (Ïƒ): The annualized volatility of the underlying asset's returns.

#Usage
-Clone the repository or download the Python script.
-Open the script in a Python environment.
-Modify the input parameters (S, K, T, r, and vol) as needed.
-Run the script.

#The script will output:

-The values of d1 and d2.
-The theoretical price of the call option.
-The theoretical price of the put option.
